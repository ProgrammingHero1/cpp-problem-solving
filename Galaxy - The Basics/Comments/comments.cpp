    //Comments are useful things to do.
    //Because, it makes code easier for other to understand.
    //For example, see the comment before the object "cout" of ostream.
    //From that comment you can see, the object cout is used for printing something.
    
    //So, you can write comment in two ways.
    //For single line comment put double slash with no space at the beginning of the line.
    //For example: This is a comment in a single line.
    
    //For multiple line comment put slash asterisk (/*) at the beginning of the program and
    // asterisk slash (*/) at the end of the comment
    /* For example: This is a
     comment of a
     Multiple line*/

	//There is another way to write multiple lines of comment
	//and we have already done it. Can you guess how?

	//Printing Hello, World!
    cout << "Hello, World!\n";
    return 0;
